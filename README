Hello,

Libraries
We used OpenCV in our projct to do video parsing, hough line detection, Matrix operations, etc.

Source Files
main.cpp
LinePrediction.cpp and .h <- Does white pixel detection and line prediction
ModelFitting.cpp and .h <- Does Model fitting
Player.cpp and .h <- Does background subtraction and Tracking


Compiling and Running
Our makefile uses pkg-config to link to the opencv libraries. 
To compile our project type make clean and then make.
This will generate a demo executable file. Then just type ./demo 
to run our code.
